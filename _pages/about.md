Data Analyst & Management Controller, Power BI Expert & Advanced Excel Proficiency

About Me
======

Data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Naturally curious, driven by challenges, and committed to continuous learning and knowledge sharing.

I specialize in [data visualization and analysis](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) using Power BI and Excel, crafting interactive dashboards and delivering actionable insights. I enjoy solving business problems with data, whether it's optimizing processes, identifying trends, or driving strategic decisions. Some of my recent projects include insurance policy analysis, space mission dashboards, and sales analytics for various industries.

My expertise spans advanced data modeling, DAX, and Power BI reporting. I frequently engage in community challenges like [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/profile/kadrimohamed) and [DataDNA](https://www.onyxdata.co.uk/datadna) to sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge base.

I transitioned into data analytics from a background in agriculture and logistics, leveraging my previous experience to offer a unique perspective in data-driven decision-making. This diverse experience allows me to communicate complex findings in a clear and impactful way.

Currently working at [Agrovision Corp](https://www.agrovisioncorp.com/), analyzing agricultural and export data to improve operations and drive growth. I hold certifications in Power BI and data analysis.
